# Tenders Electronic Daily

## Context

The procurement of goods and services is one of the core tasks a government must successfully accomplish to keep a country running. According to the World Bank, trillions of euros are spent every year by governments in what is the largest global marketplace, and the EU with its single market is one of the largest players within it. Transparency of taxpayer-money allocation in procurement processes is hence paramount to government accountability.

Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) is the online version of the EU’s public procurement journal. TED offers free and open access to tender and contract documents in XML format dating back to 1993. The documents contain information like contracting entity, description of the services rendered and contract value.

## Problem definition

While the availability of TED documents is a great asset for transparency, producing actionable insights requires significant understanding of the repository’s documents, databases and systems in addition to data science skills. Without these, accessing the data, consolidating reports and generating knowledge can seem daunting, rendering transparency of EU procurement a luxury out of the reach of most stakeholders.

## Proposal

While some level of technical knowledge is ineluctable, access to TED data can be improved by the provision of tools that facilitate the production of actionable insights. The ExtractTED repository on GitHub, published by the UKs Office for National Statistics, offers Python functions to extract, validate and tidy TED XML files. Our project will build on these tools and create new ones to facilitate the exploration and analysis of the TED database.

In order to achieve the aforementioned, we will create a set of functions written in Python (possibly delivered in a package) that automate the production of consolidated reports based on user queries. While the production of a finished and proper Python module for this purpose is beyond our current skillset, the scope of the course and available time, we will create a working prototype that should serve as a proof of concept. 

## Learning objectives
With this proposal we will be applying what we have learned in the course to a real life problem, tackling the hurdles presented by an actual data science project. Moreover, the exercise will allow us to better understand the challenges posed by public problems as specific as public procurement and tendering, and as general as transparency and accountability. We believe this blend is precisely the kind of problem that we should learn to come up with solutions as datas scientists oriented to the public good.
